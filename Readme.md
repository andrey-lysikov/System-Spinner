## Features

- Switching between desktops using advenced buttons 3 and 4 on Logitech mice
- Custom OSD in MacOS for volume and brightness control (with a switch)
- Custom adjustment steps (more accurate volume and brightness control, also "cmd" activates fine-tuning)
- Top CPU/MEM processes in popup window, with 10 top processes in detail
- Memory statistics with swap, and real used memory
- Network utilisation and external ip address (uses checkip.dyndns.org, you can turn off showing external ip)
- SMC information for CPU temp and fan (scanned automatics)
- Full MacOS Liquid Glass support
- Localization (English, Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Russian)

*WARNING: The application is not officially signed, you will need to allow it to run in "Settings" -> "Security" when you first launch it.*

## Tech
Written in Swift 6, Apple Silicon only, for MacOS 26 and newer

## Troubleshooting

If for some reason you don't see the temperature/battery and fan sensors, please run the diagnostics from the archive in the release, `system-diagnostic.zip`.
Unzip it to any folder and run it in a terminal:

    bash run-probe.sh

It writes `probe-<model>.tsv` — please attach that file to an [issue](https://github.com/andrey-lysikov/System-Spinner/issues).
